ClanMarkr - bookmarking app
Using the Sinatra experience we've gained this week, create an app where users can store urls of websites they've visited.

From the homepage, the user should be able to add a new URL and give it a name/title and classify it into a genre.

The user should also be able to edit and delete bookmarks.

Finally, there should be the ability to view bookmarks by genre.

Add some unique-to-you feeling to the app too!
